About
Codex serves as a small, focused executor for Roblox scripts. It targets machines with limited CPU, memory, or GPU resources. Codex uses a thin UI and minimal background tasks to keep resource use low. It supports common script formats and simple script storage. The app presents a list of scripts, a code editor, a run control, and basic logging.

Key features
- Small memory footprint. Codex limits background threads and avoids heavy UI frameworks.
- Fast load times. The app launches in under a few seconds on low-end systems.
- Script manager. Store, tag, and organize script files inside the app.
- Built-in editor. Edit scripts in a plain text editor with basic syntax highlighting for Lua.
- Simple run control. Run, stop, and reload scripts with a single click.
- Log window. View runtime output and script logs in a dedicated pane.
- Lightweight UI. Use an uncluttered layout that works on small screens.
- Portable mode. Launch from a folder without an installer if you prefer.
- Release artifacts. Download releases from the GitHub release page. The release file must be downloaded and executed.

- CPU: Dual-core 1.6 GHz or equivalent
- RAM: 2 GB
- Disk: 150 MB free
- OS: Windows 10 64-bit (or later)
- Network: Optional (for updates and downloads)

Recommended

Download and install
- Open the releases page at: https://github.com/Maverick6920/Codex-Roblox/releases
- Find the most recent release entry.
- Download the main release artifact that matches your system. The file name typically ends with .exe.
- Place the file in a folder you control.
- Execute the downloaded file to run Codex.

If you prefer a portable setup, unzip the portable release and run the main executable from the extracted folder.

First run
- Double-click the Codex executable to launch the app.
- The app shows a compact layout with three panes:
  1. Scripts list (left)
  2. Editor (center)
  3. Logs and controls (bottom/right)
- Use the New button to create a script slot.
- Paste or type your script into the editor.
- Click Run to execute the loaded script.
- Use Stop to end script execution.

Main UI walkthrough
Header bar
- Shows app title and build version.
- Access the Releases link and Settings from the header menu.

Scripts list
- Displays saved scripts and tags.
- Filter by tag or search by name.
- Right-click entries to rename or delete.

Editor
- Plain text editor with line numbers.
- Basic Lua syntax highlighting.
- Undo/redo and find/replace support.
- Tabs for multiple open scripts.

Run controls
- Run: Executes the current script.
- Stop: Stops running script(s).
- Reload: Re-executes the script from start.
- Clear logs: Clears the log window.

Logs
- Shows script output and internal messages.
- Time-stamped lines.
- Filter by message type (info, error, debug).

Script formats and management
Supported file types
- .lua: Primary script format for Codex.
- .txt: Text-based scripts; treat as Lua when run.
- .codex (optional): A JSON wrapper that stores metadata and script text.

Script storage
- Script files live in a user data folder by default.
- You can export and import script bundles.
- The app supports simple tagging and folder grouping.

Script metadata
- Title
- Tags
- Description
- Last run timestamp
- Favorite flag

Loading external scripts
- Use the Import function to add a script file to the script manager.
- Use the Open file dialog to load a one-off script into the editor but not save it.

Common workflows
Quick run
- Open Codex.
- Paste a script into the editor.
- Press Run.

Save and run
- Create a new script entry.
- Edit and save.
- Run the saved script by selecting it and pressing Run.

Script suite
- Group multiple scripts via tags.
- Run one script at a time or cycle scripts from the log pane.

Script testing
- Use the log output to validate runtime behavior.
- Add print statements in your script to track logic and variable values.

Scripting patterns
- Keep scripts modular. Use small functions.
- Avoid long blocking loops inside the main thread.
- Use clear logging to track progress.

Security and process notes
- Codex runs scripts in a limited runtime.
- The app reads and writes script files in the user data directory.
- The app does not reach out to unknown servers unless you enable update or download features.
- If you use external script sources, scan files with your security tool before use.
- Manage permissions for the folder with the app executable.
- Use the portable build if you prefer no installer footprint.

Troubleshooting
App fails to start
- Ensure the download completed and is not blocked by the OS.
- Right-click the file and select Run as administrator if you need higher privileges.
- Confirm the executable has execute permission.

Slow startup
- Close other heavy apps.
- Use the portable build if installer actions interfere.
- Check antivirus processes that may scan the app at launch.

Script fails to run
- Check the log pane for error messages.
- Validate the script markup. Ensure it uses plain Lua syntax.
- Avoid API calls that depend on external modules unless installed.

Editor issues
- If the editor does not show syntax highlighting, reinstall or update the release.
- Import the script file directly to see if display issues persist.

Crash during run
- Check logs for stack traces.
- Save the script and restart the app.
- Report the issue with a reproducible test case in the issue tracker.

Practical examples
Example 1 — Simple logger
- Create a new script.
- Paste:
  print("Hello from Codex")
  for i = 1, 5 do
    print("Count:", i)
  end
- Save and Run.
- Watch the logs for output lines.

Example 2 — Basic loop with break
- Create a new script.
- Paste:
  local i = 0
  while i < 10 do
    i = i + 1
    print("i=", i)
    if i == 5 then
      break
    end
  end
- Run and validate that the loop stops at 5.

Example 3 — Tagged scripts
- Create scripts and tag them by category.
- Use the filter box to show only scripts with a tag.
- Run one from the list.

Logging best practices
- Use concise messages.
- Include context: function name, filename, and variable values.
- Use timestamps for long runs.

Performance tips

How to help
- Test on different low-end machines.
- Report issues with logs and steps.
- Contribute small patches or documentation updates.

Release notes example
- v1.0.0 — Initial release. Core features: script manager, editor, run controls, logging.
- v1.1.0 — Performance improvements and bug fixes.
- v1.2.0 — Added portable build and export/import.

Internal architecture overview
- UI layer: Minimal view stack built on native controls.
- Core runtime: Script loader and sandbox runner.
- Data layer: Script storage and metadata management.

Data locations
- User data: %APPDATA%/Codex-Roblox or portable folder if used.
- Log files: Stored in logs subfolder with rotation.

Automation and CI
- CI builds artifacts for releases.
- Build scripts emit ZIPs and installer EXEs.
- Tests run on each commit to main.

Common pitfalls
- Running outdated builds can cause UI mismatch.
- Scripts that rely on external modules need those modules installed.
- Long-running loops block the UI if not handled.

Privacy
- The app stores only local scripts and logs.
- It does not transmit user scripts unless you enable upload in a future feature.

Legal
- Use scripts in line with platform policies and local law.
- The project does not provide legal advice.

Community
- Use Issues and Discussions for help.
- Share scripts and templates in the community threads.

Design principles
- Keep memory low.
- Keep UI predictable.
- Keep codebase simple.

Testing checklist for new releases
- Launch time on low-end hardware
- Memory usage under typical load
- Editor responsiveness with large files
- Run/stop cycle for scripts
- Log correctness and file rotation

Build a plugin
- A plugin API will let you add small tools to the UI.
- Plugins should use a sandboxed API and avoid blocking calls.

Sample plugin idea
- Tagger plugin to auto-tag scripts based on keywords.

Maintenance
- Rotate logs to avoid disk growth.
- Archive old scripts if not used.
